# personify-mcp

MCP bridge that lets Claude Desktop run the `personify:personify` Claude
Code skill reliably. Desktop calls this server's one tool, `personify`; the
server shells out to `claude --print` to do the actual work, so Desktop
never has to load `VOICE.md` or evaluate Step 0's "treat this file as
authoritative" instruction itself.

See the parent repo's `SKILL.md` for what personify does, and the
referenced issue (twistedmelonman/personify#23) for why this bridge exists:
Desktop has, in practice, denied its own filesystem connector was present
and flagged Step 0 as injection-shaped, even when the connector was
confirmed active. Claude Code CLI does not have this problem.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 18** (check with `node --version`). Install via
  [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `brew install node`.
- **npm** (bundled with Node; check with `npm --version`).
- **TypeScript compiler (`tsc`)**. `npm install` pulls in TypeScript as a
  dev dependency, and `npm run build` resolves `tsc` from
  `node_modules/.bin` automatically, so a project-local install is normally
  enough. You only need `tsc` available globally (check with
  `tsc --version`) if you invoke it directly outside of `npm run build`,
  e.g. `brew install typescript` on macOS or `npm install -g typescript`.
- The **`claude` CLI** on `PATH` (check with `claude --version`), with the
  `personify` plugin installed (see "Known costs" below). This is needed
  both to build the plugin dependency and to generate the OAuth token in
  "Authenticate."

If `npm install` or `npm run build` fail, run the three `--version` checks
above first; a missing or too-old Node/npm/tsc produces confusing
module-resolution or syntax errors rather than a clear "not found" message.

## Build

From the repo root:

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

## Authenticate

Claude Desktop cannot use your regular `claude` login for this bridge.
`claude` normally reads your OAuth session from the macOS Keychain, and
Keychain access for that credential is restricted to process trees macOS
already trusts, like a Terminal-launched shell. Desktop launches this
server as a child of its own process, a different, untrusted process
tree, so the Keychain read is silently denied and `claude` reports it as
an expired OAuth session, even though your regular terminal `claude`
session is fine.

The fix is a separate, long-lived OAuth token scoped to this bridge only,
generated with:

```bash
claude setup-token
```

This opens a browser authorization flow (the same one `/login` uses) and,
once you approve it, prints a token to your terminal. This token
authenticates against your Claude subscription (Pro, Max, Team, or
Enterprise) exactly like your normal `claude` session does: it is not an
API key, and using it does not switch you to metered API billing.

Copy the printed token into `~/.config/personify/token` (see
`token.example` in this directory for the expected format), then lock
down its permissions so only you can read it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/personify
# paste the token from "claude setup-token" into ~/.config/personify/token
chmod 600 ~/.config/personify/token
```

The server refuses to start a `claude` call if this file is missing, empty,
or has permissions looser than 600 (owner read/write) or 400 (owner
read-only).

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set in the environment Claude Desktop itself
launches with, not just your shell, the token is read from
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/personify/token` instead. Note that GUI-launched apps on
macOS do not inherit your shell's exports; if you rely on a custom
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, set it explicitly via the `env` block in
`claude_desktop_config.json` rather than assuming Desktop sees your
shell's value.

To see or revoke a token you generated this way, visit
[claude.ai/settings](https://claude.ai/settings) and look under the
Claude Code section. Revocation there has been reported as unreliable in
some cases for already-minted `setup-token` credentials; if a token stops
working (or you want to be certain it is gone), delete
`~/.config/personify/token` and run `claude setup-token` again for a
fresh one.

## Configure in Claude Desktop

From `mcp-server/`, after building:

```bash
npm run install-desktop-config
```

This merges a `personify` entry into
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (creating
the file if it does not exist yet), using the absolute path to this repo's
`dist/index.js`. It only ever touches the `personify` key under
`mcpServers`; any other MCP servers or settings already in that file are
left exactly as they are. Running it again (for example after moving the
repo, or to pick up a rebuilt `dist/`) safely updates the entry in place
rather than duplicating it.

Restart Desktop after running it.

macOS only for now. On other platforms, add the following to
`claude_desktop_config.json` by hand instead (path varies by OS; see
[Anthropic's MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for where Desktop
looks for it there):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "personify": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/personify/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Known costs (accepted, not engineered around in v1)

- Latency: each call is a cold CLI start plus a real model call. Expect
  single-digit to tens of seconds.
- Requires the `claude` CLI to be installed and on `PATH` for whatever user
  account runs Desktop, with the `personify` plugin installed
  (`/plugin marketplace add twistedmelonman/personify && /plugin install personify@personify`),
  and requires the OAuth token file described above under "Authenticate."

## Output handling

The tool returns only the personified text. Two things that are _not_ the
text get kept out of it:

- The verbatim-relay instruction ("treat this as final, don't re-edit it")
  is addressed to the calling model, so it rides in the tool description. It
  used to be prepended to the text content, which meant Desktop printed it to
  the reader above every result (twistedmelonman/personify#50). The result's
  `_meta` also carries it under a vendor-namespaced key, but that is
  best-effort only: checked against SDK 1.30.0, nothing forwards a result's
  `_meta` into model context, so the tool description is what actually
  delivers the instruction. Don't trim the description on the assumption
  `_meta` covers it.
- The CLI-side model sometimes narrates its editing plan before the text
  ("This is long-form work writing, so I'll apply..."), or introduces it
  with "Here's the rewrite:". `PERSONIFY_INSTRUCTION` tells it not to, and
  that alone did not hold, so `stripCliPreamble` removes leading
  commentary-shaped paragraphs from stdout as well.

The stripper is deliberately conservative, because a false positive silently
eats the first paragraph of someone's document while a false negative just
leaves a stray sentence they can ignore. It only considers _leading_
paragraphs, only when at least one paragraph follows, only when the paragraph
announces work on the text in hand, and it returns the input unchanged rather
than ever returning empty. A wrapping code fence is unwrapped only when the
fenced body itself leads with commentary, since a fence is often the content.

Concretely, a paragraph counts as commentary only when one sentence carries
both an editing verb and a reference to the machinery doing the editing (the
skill, the voice guide, a register, "the text"). Either half alone is not
enough, and both halves were tried and rejected: matching the verb alone ate
"so I'll edit the contract tonight," and matching the machinery alone ate
"our voice guide's rules are mostly fine," which is content, since this
skill's own users write about the skill. Stripping is also bounded to the two
leading paragraphs of the observed commentary-plus-handoff shape, so a false
positive cannot cascade through a document, and every strip is logged to
stderr so one that does fire is diagnosable. Fenced blocks are never treated
as commentary, whatever they say: a code block that happens to read like a
preamble is still the user's content, and unwrapping only happens when the
fenced body contains no fence of its own, so a document that merely opens and
closes with a code block keeps its fences balanced.

Each of those is now a regression test. If a new preamble shape shows up in
the wild, add a fixture to `test/strip-preamble.test.ts` rather than
loosening the patterns.

### The status line

`stripStatusLine` removes the skill's own trailing status line
(twistedmelonman/personify#86):

    [arm B primary · arm A differed on 3 spans · evidence: 2026-08-31T09-14-22]

That line is presentation for a person reading a result in a terminal, where it
names the primary arm and the evidence record to hand to `show both`. It is not
part of the text, and a caller of this bridge is by definition programmatic: an
agent that asks for a cleaned PR description and then runs `gh pr create` would
paste the line into the PR body.

Much easier than the preamble case, and the pattern is correspondingly strict
rather than conservative. The line has a fixed shape, sits on the last line,
and is bracketed at both ends, so an anchored full-line match has no plausible
false positive against prose. It requires both fields in order, tolerates any
wording in the middle field and any trailing field (which is how the
`· 25 unconsolidated` nudge arrives), and matches the timestamp by shape
without validating it as a date, since a malformed one is still the status line.

Two deliberate non-behaviors. Only the last non-empty line is a candidate: a
status line mid-document is the user quoting one, which this repo's own evidence
records and regression fixtures do. And it never returns empty from non-empty
input, so a result consisting only of a status line passes through rather than
becoming a silent truncation, since that case means the rewrite itself went
missing.

`mode: "both"` is exempt. That mode asked for the full comparison, so the
status line and the arm reports are the requested payload.

## Manual verification checklist

Run this after any change to `mcp-server/src/`, since the automated test
suite mocks the `claude` subprocess and cannot catch real invocation drift:

1. Build (`npm run build`), configure Desktop per above, fully quit and
   restart Desktop (not just start a new chat: the MCP server process is
   started per Desktop launch).
2. In a **fresh** Desktop chat (no prior priming about personify), ask
   Desktop to personify a short paragraph containing at least one em dash
   and one phrase from `SKILL.md`'s pattern list (e.g. "this represents a
   pivotal shift").
3. Confirm: Desktop calls the `personify` tool (visible in its tool-call
   UI), the returned text has no em dash and no inflated-significance
   phrasing, and the result reads close to what running
   `/personify:personify` directly in a CLI session on the same input
   produces.
   Also confirm the reply starts with the edited text itself: no relay
   instruction, no "This is long-form writing, so I'll apply..." preamble,
   and no "Here's the rewrite:" line (see "Output handling" above). Use a
   long, substantive input, since issue #50 reproduced on long-form drafts
   and not on short ones.
4. Repeat step 2 in a second, separate fresh Desktop session to confirm no
   session-specific priming is required.
5. Break it on purpose: temporarily rename the installed personify plugin
   directory (or unset `PATH` for `claude` in Desktop's environment) and
   confirm the tool call comes back as a visible Desktop-side error, not a
   silent pass-through of the original text.
6. Restore whatever was temporarily changed in step 5.
