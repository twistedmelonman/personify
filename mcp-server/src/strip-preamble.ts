// The CLI-side model sometimes narrates its own editing plan before emitting
// the personified text, despite PERSONIFY_INSTRUCTION saying "no commentary,
// no preamble" (twistedmelonman/personify#50). Prompt wording alone did not
// hold, so the leak is also removed here.
//
// The stripping is deliberately conservative. A false negative leaves a stray
// sentence the user can see and ignore; a false positive silently eats the
// first paragraph of their document. Every rule below therefore requires the
// candidate to look like commentary *about* the editing task, and none of
// them will remove the only paragraph present.
//
// Why strip rather than detect-and-retry, which would have no false-positive
// mode at all: a retry costs a second cold CLI start plus a second model call,
// and DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS is 30s for the first one. There is no headroom for a
// second inside a Desktop tool call. If that budget ever grows, retry is the
// better design and this file should shrink to a detector.

// Meta-commentary announcing what the model is about to do.
//
// Two failed approaches are worth recording, because the fix sits between
// them. Enumerating announcing verbs (apply|use|run|rewrite|edit) missed a
// live leak built on "classify," and 17 of 23 plausible verbs slipped through:
// the model picks its verb from the whole language, so verb lists never close.
// Widening to this skill's general vocabulary (long-form, compression, "step
// 3", first person) plus any first-person phrase went far too far the other
// way, eating 9 of 10 realistic paragraphs about writing, since people who use
// this tool write about writing constantly.
//
// What actually separates the two is narrower than either: a named rule
// artifact AND a first-person authoring clause, in the same sentence. Both
// halves are required. A person writing about writing says "per the voice
// guide, we cut hedges" or "I keep using the voice guide when I draft"; they
// mention the artifact without announcing that they are editing this text by
// it. A preamble says "so I'll apply the voice guide's rules." An earlier
// draft matched a preposition plus the bare noun, with no authoring clause,
// and ate the first paragraph of all seven of those realistic sentences.
//
// Gap quantifiers are bounded rather than open. Sentence-scoped [^.]* was
// clean O(n^2) on a long unpunctuated paragraph (367ms at 104KB); the bound
// makes that 0ms and costs nothing, since a real preamble clause is short.

// text. Adverbs may sit between ("I'll now apply"), nothing else: the gap that
// let "I'll be honest: the voice guide's rules..." through was allowing

//
// The verb list is narrow on purpose. General-purpose verbs like "use," "run,"
// "follow," and "keep" were in it and produced false positives, because they
// take objects other than text: "I'm using the voice guide's notes to teach the
