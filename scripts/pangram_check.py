"""Submit text to Pangram's detector once and report the verdict.

Reads raw bytes on stdin, writes a JSON result on stdout, and writes every
diagnostic to stderr. On a Human verdict it records a stamp keyed by the
sha256 of the raw stdin bytes, so a hook can later confirm that the exact
bytes being published were classified.

There is no edit loop. Measured data (Phase 0 of the Personify 2.0 plan)
shows that editing prose toward the detector does not move the verdict, so
the client submits each artifact exactly once. It retries only on transport
failures, never on a result.

INVOCATION CONTRACT, and it is load-bearing. Redirect the file into stdin:

    python3 pangram_check.py < body.md

Two flags run without reading stdin and without touching the network:

    python3 pangram_check.py --check-key     exit 0 if a key resolves, else 5
    python3 pangram_check.py --install-key   copy the key from 1Password into
                                             the macOS login Keychain

The stamp is keyed by the sha256 of the bytes stdin delivers, and the hook
hashes the file that `git commit -F` or `gh pr create --body-file` reads. Those
two hashes match only when stdin IS that file. `echo "$text" | pangram_check.py`
appends a trailing newline, changing the hash, and the stamp then matches
nothing. A pass earned that way silently fails to authorize the publish.

Exit codes:
    0  PASS         verdict Human; a stamp was written
    2  FAIL         verdict AI
    3  FAIL_MIXED   verdict Mixed
    4  SKIPPED      under the 40-word floor; no verdict, no stamp
    5  UNAVAILABLE  no secret, transport failure, STAGE_FAILED, bad usage

Any unexpected exception also exits 5, so a caller that reads the exit code
fails closed rather than mistaking a crash for a pass.

    The stamp carries `task_id` because that is what makes it hard to forge:
    GET /task/{id} can be re-read and returns both the verdict and the
    classified text, so a checker can confirm a stamp against Pangram rather
    than trusting bytes an agent could have written with echo.

    Stamps live under the personify config dir, never under
    ~/.claude/gate-review/, which hook-block-gate-dir-write.sh blocks.

    A stamp is what a hook trusts to allow a publish, so it is written 0600 in
    a 0700 directory. Default umask would leave it 0644 in a 0755 directory,
    where any local process could overwrite one and manufacture a pass. The
    temp file is created with the narrow mode rather than chmod'd afterwards,
    so the bytes are never on disk at a wider mode even briefly. mkdir's `mode`
    argument is masked by umask and does nothing to an existing directory, so
    the chmod on the directory runs explicitly.
